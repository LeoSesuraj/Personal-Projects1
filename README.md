## Projects Overview

# **1. Digit Classification - Neural Network from Scratch**

This project implements a fully functional neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy, with no reliance on external deep learning libraries. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits, demonstrating foundational concepts in machine learning and deep learning.

---

## **Key Features**
- Three-layer neural network: Input, two hidden layers, and an output layer.
- Activation functions: ReLU and Softmax.
- Training using mini-batch gradient descent.
- Complete implementation of forward propagation, backpropagation, and parameter updates.

---

## **Objectives**
- Gain an in-depth understanding of neural network mechanics by coding one from scratch.
- Learn to preprocess image data and apply mathematical operations for learning.
- Visualize the training process and performance metrics.


# **2. Cellphone Price Prediction - Random Forest Regressor**

This project demonstrates the use of a Random Forest Regressor to predict cellphone prices based on various features like brand, specifications, and other characteristics. The model is trained on a real-world dataset and evaluated using key regression metrics to understand its predictive accuracy.

---

## **Key Features**
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized relationships and correlations between features using pairplots and heatmaps.
- Random Forest Model: Used Random Forest Regressor to predict prices, trained with 96% of the data and tested on 4%.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assessed model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.

---

## **Objectives**
- Gain experience with Random Forest models and understand how decision trees are used for regression.
- Learn data cleaning techniques and the importance of feature selection in machine learning.
- Apply visualization techniques to understand data relationships and model performance.
- Evaluate model performance using common regression metrics and interpret results.
